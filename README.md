# password-generater
This is a Password Generator and Strength Checker project that allows users to generate strong random passwords and assess the strength of passwords they input.

## Features
### Password Generator: Generate strong random passwords with customizable length and character sets (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters).
### Password Strength Checker: Analyze the strength of passwords entered by users and provide feedback on their strength level (weak, medium, strong).
### Copy Password: Users can easily copy the generated password to their clipboard for easy use.
## How to Use
1) Clone the repository to your local machine.

2)Open the index.html file in your web browser.

## Password Generator:

4) Use the slider to select the desired password length.
5) Check the boxes for character sets you want to include in the password (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols).
6) Click the "Generate Password" button to create a strong random password based on your selections.
7) The generated password will be displayed in the "Password" input field.
## Password Strength Checker:

8) Enter the password you want to assess in the "Check Password Strength" input field.
9) The app will automatically analyze the password and provide feedback on its strength level below the input field.
10) Password strength is categorized as "Weak," "Medium," or "Strong" based on the complexity of the password.
## Password Strength Criteria
The password strength checker uses the following criteria to assess the strength of passwords:

### Weak Password: Passwords that are short in length or contain only letters (uppercase or lowercase) are considered weak.
### Medium Password: Passwords that include a combination of letters (uppercase and lowercase) and numbers are categorized as medium strength.
### Strong Password: Passwords that include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters are classified as strong.
## How Passwords are Generated
The password generator uses a combination of character sets (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols) based on the user's selections.
At least one character from each selected character set is included in the generated password.
The remaining characters are randomly selected from the chosen character sets to create a strong and randomized password.
## Limitations
1) The password strength assessment is based on simple criteria and may not cover all aspects of password security.
2) The generated passwords are not saved or stored by the application, and refreshing the page will clear the generated password.
